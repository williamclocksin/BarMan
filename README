BarMan is an experimental music notation editor, written in TypeScript, in which nothing is assumed.
So, bars of music may be unmeasured, contain different numbers of beats, different lengths, and polymetres.
BarMan's formatting algorithm will format what it can. There is an option to format according to
polymetres with or without coinciding barlines.
The point of this is so the user can draft incomplete music notation without constraint,
and without receiving error messages.

The directory include source from Graphics-Editor, which I am using to learn about TypeScript and making a
graphic editor can eventually become a music notation editor.
